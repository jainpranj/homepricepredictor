Gradient Boosting Regressor basic example to predict price of house


Value estimation—one of the most common types of machine learning algorithms—can automatically estimate values by looking at related information. For example, a website can determine how much a house is worth based on the property's location and characteristics. In this project-based course, discover how to use machine learning to build a value estimation system that can deduce the value of a home.
